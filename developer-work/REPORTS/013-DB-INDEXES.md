# Task Report: 013 — DB-INDEXES

**Task ID:** 013
**Category:** Architecture
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completed Date:** 2026-02-19
**Time Spent:** 2 hours 20 minutes
**Estimated Time:** 3 hours

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria — All Met

- [x] Criterion 1: All indexes added via Alembic migration (not raw SQL)
- [x] Criterion 2: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` run before/after target queries
- [x] Criterion 3: Index creation done with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid locking production
- [x] Criterion 4: No duplicate indexes (existing equivalent indexes detected and skipped)
- [x] Criterion 5: Index names follow convention: `idx_{table}_{columns}`

## 📝 What Was Implemented

### **Files Created:**
- `alembic/versions/009_add_performance_indexes.py`
- `developer-work/REPORTS/013-DB-INDEXES.md`

### **Files Modified:**
- `alembic/versions/001_initial_schema_baseline.py`
- `architect-work/TASKS/013-DB-INDEXES.md`

### **Changes Made:**

**1. New performance index migration**
- Added Alembic revision `009_add_performance_indexes`.
- Implemented all required indexes with `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS`.
- Implemented `downgrade()` with `DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF EXISTS`.

**2. Duplicate index protection**
- Migration inspects `pg_indexes` and skips creating an index if:
  - the same index name already exists, or
  - an equivalent legacy index already exists (e.g. `idx_customers_visits_customer_date`, `idx_customer_photo_customer_id`).

**3. Environment-safe behavior**
- Added table-existence guard to avoid failure on installations where some optional tables are absent (e.g. `Sales.warehouse_stock`).

**4. Alembic baseline compatibility fix**
- Fixed `alembic/versions/001_initial_schema_baseline.py` to execute baseline SQL through `exec_driver_sql`, avoiding SQLAlchemy bind parsing errors on colon characters in SQL comments.
- This prevents migration bootstrap failures unrelated to Task 013 logic.

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### **Local Tests:**
```bash
python -m compileall alembic/versions/009_add_performance_indexes.py alembic/versions/001_initial_schema_baseline.py
# Result: SUCCESS
```

```bash
python -m pytest -q
# Result: 12 passed
```

### **Migration Tests:**
```bash
alembic stamp 008_add_test_cities_territories
# Result: SUCCESS

alembic upgrade head
# Result: SUCCESS (upgraded to 009_add_performance_indexes)

alembic current -v
# Result: head = 009_add_performance_indexes
```

### **DB Verification (`pg_indexes`):**
Created by migration (10):
- `idx_customers_login_agent`
- `idx_customers_login_expeditor`
- `idx_customers_name_gin`
- `idx_orders_customer_status`
- `idx_orders_delivery_date`
- `idx_orders_order_date`
- `idx_operations_warehouse_from`
- `idx_operations_created_by_date`
- `idx_visits_date_responsible`
- `idx_batches_expiry`

Skipped as equivalent already existing:
- `idx_visits_customer_id` (covered by `idx_customers_visits_customer_date`)
- `idx_photos_customer_id` (covered by `idx_customer_photo_customer_id`)

Skipped due missing table in this environment:
- `idx_stock_warehouse_code`
- `idx_stock_warehouse_product` (`Sales.warehouse_stock` table absent)

### **EXPLAIN ANALYZE (before/after):**
- Executed before and after on top query patterns for customers, orders, operations, visits.
- On current low-volume dataset planner still prefers Seq Scan for most queries (expected on small tables).
- Index presence confirmed in catalog and ready for large-volume workload where planner cost favors index scans.

## ⚠️ Issues Encountered & Resolved

Issue 1: `alembic upgrade` failed in baseline migration due SQLAlchemy bind parsing (`:role` inside baseline SQL comments).
Resolution: Switched baseline execution to `exec_driver_sql` in `001_initial_schema_baseline.py`.

Issue 2: `Sales.warehouse_stock` table missing in current DB, causing index DDL failure.
Resolution: Added table existence check in migration; index creation for missing tables is safely skipped.
