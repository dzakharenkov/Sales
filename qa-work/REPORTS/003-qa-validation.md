## Test Results Summary

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Unit Test Coverage | 90% | 22% | ? |
| Integration Tests | 100% executed | 9 skipped (DB unavailable) | ? |
| Static Typing | 0 errors | 1353 | ? |
| Linting | 0 issues | 1795 | ? |
| Security (Bandit) | 0 high/med | 28 findings | ? |
| Security (Safety) | 0 vulnerabilities | 19 | ? |

## Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [ ] All `text()` queries use `:param` placeholders, never f-strings with user data
- [ ] All `text()` queries pass params via `.bindparams()` or the `params={}` argument
- [ ] Audit complete — every router file reviewed, findings documented
- [ ] No `f"...{variable}..."` patterns inside `text()` calls remain
- [ ] Search filter inputs (search strings) are properly escaped or parameterized

## Findings
- Integration DB-dependent tests are skipped due environment connectivity: `Integration DB is unavailable: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection`.
- Global quality gates are currently red; this affects strict approval status per QA template.
