## Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [ ] `allow_origins` set to production domain (`https://sales.zakharenkov.ru`) in production
- [ ] `allow_origins` can be configured via environment variable for development flexibility
- [ ] Security headers added: `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`
- [ ] Local development still works with `http://localhost:*` allowed
- [ ] Preflight requests (`OPTIONS`) handled correctly

## Findings
- Integration DB-dependent tests are skipped due environment connectivity: `Integration DB is unavailable: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection`.
- Global quality gates are currently red; this affects strict approval status per QA template.
