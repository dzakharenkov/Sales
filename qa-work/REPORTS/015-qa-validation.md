## Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [ ] No raw exception messages exposed to API clients
- [ ] All 500 errors logged with full traceback internally
- [ ] All errors return structured JSON: `{"error": {"code": "...", "message": "..."}}`
- [ ] Custom exception classes for business logic errors
- [ ] Global exception handlers registered on FastAPI app
- [ ] Database errors caught and converted to user-friendly messages
- [ ] Validation errors (Pydantic) formatted consistently

## Findings
- Integration DB-dependent tests are skipped due environment connectivity: `Integration DB is unavailable: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection`.
- Global quality gates are currently red; this affects strict approval status per QA template.
