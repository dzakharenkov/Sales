## Acceptance Criteria Validation
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs on every push to `main` and every PR
- [ ] `lint` job: ruff check must pass
- [ ] `test` job: pytest must pass with >=50% coverage
- [ ] `security` job: runs basic security scan (bandit via ruff `S` rules)
- [ ] Failed CI blocks PR merge (branch protection rules)
- [ ] Deployment job (optional): deploys to Ubuntu server on push to `main` (manual approval gate)
- [ ] CI status badge added to project README

## Findings
- Integration DB-dependent tests are skipped due environment connectivity: `Integration DB is unavailable: [WinError 1225] The remote computer refused the network connection`.
- Global quality gates are currently red; this affects strict approval status per QA template.
